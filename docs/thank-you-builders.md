# Thank you builders

Without you, the content on this site would have been acquired via manual survey, compiled and analyzed painstakingly by hand, and forged in a large print warehouse. Locating the builders who might find this information useful would have been costly ad placement in universities and large corporations. Getting you the content would have meant physically delivering the materials to your door, and providing you a way to ask for more via the same. 

With so many important technologies built, the information on this platform was brought to your timeline with a simple database interface and an obliging LLM engineering assistant. So, thank you, builder for giving us these tools.
